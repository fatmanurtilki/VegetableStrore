            <p class="lead">The <span>fig</span> is recognized as one of the world's oldest cultivated fruits, with its
              history
              reaching back approximately 5,000 years to the Near East, specifically the region of Upper Mesopotamia.
              From its origins, it spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin, becoming a staple in ancient civilizations
              like Greece and Rome. Due to its significance, the fig quickly adopted symbolic meaning, representing
              fertility, abundance, and prosperity across cultures. The Greek philosopher Plato famously called the fig
              the "Friend of Philosophers" due to the belief that it strengthened the mind. Furthermore, the fruit holds
              deep religious importance, frequently mentioned in the sacred texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
              While it initially thrived in Western Asia, its cultivation expanded westward, embedding the fig in the
              agriculture and mythology of the entire Mediterranean world. Today, it remains a globally popular fruit,
              consumed both fresh and dried.</p>

            <p class="lead">The <span>peach</span> boasts a history that spans millennia, predating human
              cultivation in some forms. Its definitive origin is traced back to East Asia and Central China, where it
              was first domesticated around 2000 BCE. In Chinese mythology and culture, the peach quickly gained immense
              significance as a potent symbol of immortality, longevity, and spring. Although its botanical name,
              persica, led many early observers to incorrectly assume its origin was Persia (Iran), the fruit was
              primarily transported westward through that region. The peach made its way into the Western world via the
              Romans around the 1st century, who spread it throughout Europe. Later, in the 16th century, Spanish
              explorers introduced the peach to the Americas, where it has since become a major crop. Today, the peach
              is a globally cherished fruit, with significant production across Europe, the Americas, and beyond,
              continuing its legacy as a cultural icon and culinary delight.</p>

            <p class="lead">The <span>apple</span> originated in Central Asia, specifically the mountains of modern-day
              Kazakhstan, where its wild
              ancestor thrived. The fruit spread globally via the Silk Road, reaching the Mediterranean where the Romans
              popularized its cultivation throughout Europe. In Western culture, the apple became an iconic symbol: in
              Greek mythology it represented love and conflict, notably the Golden Apple, and it is widely associated
              with the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. The appleâ€™s journey from Asian highlands to global symbol
              underscores its ancient and continuous cultural significance.</p>
